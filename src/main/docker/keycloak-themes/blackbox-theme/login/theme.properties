# ===========================

# Name of this theme as Keycloak should know it:
#   When logging in to Keycloak Admin, you will see “blackbox-theme” as an option.
#   Later in the realm settings you will select “blackbox-theme” for Login Theme.
name=blackbox-theme

# Tell Keycloak to inherit everything (FreeMarker macros, layouts, CSS, etc.)
# from the built-in “keycloak” theme. We will override only what we need.
parent=keycloak

# Internationalization: if you want to add custom messages,
# you can supply i18n message bundles under common/messages/
# For now, we’ll just fall back to Keycloak’s default translations.
